# Multithreaded-producer-consumer-text-analysis
	The code creates a system with a shared queue, where producer threads read sentences from a file and add them to the queue,
  and consumer threads consume sentences from the queue, count the number of words and characters, and update the total counts. 
  The program prints the consumed sentences, their word and character counts, and the total word and character counts at the end.
